# LLM Lab Notes

**Prompt experiments, written down.**

---

## What is this?

**LLM Lab Notes** is a public notebook of prompts and human field notes.

It collects the prompts people actually use — from simple one‑shot sentences to PRDs and SPEC documents — along with qualitative observations and reference links. The goal is not to rank models or produce objective scores, but to write down what we notice when we try things, so we don’t forget.

This is closer to lab notes than a benchmark.

## What you’ll find here

- A growing collection of real‑world prompts
- Prompts categorized by intent (one‑shot, few‑shot, PRD, SPEC, etc.)
- Human observations about how prompts behaved on different models
- Links to repos, blog posts, gists, or other references for context

---

## What this is not

- Not a benchmark
- Not an evaluation framework
- Not a leaderboard
- Not a prompt marketplace
- Not automated or objective

There are no scores, rankings, or claims about “best” models here.

## Why this exists

Models change quickly. Prompts change with them.
What we *noticed* often gets lost.

LLM Lab Notes exists to capture:
- which prompts people reach for
- why they use them
- what stood out when they tried them

Even imperfect notes are more useful than perfect benchmarks we never build.

## How to use it

- Browse prompts when you’re testing a new model
- Reuse prompts you’ve forgotten you liked
- Read qualitative notes to get a feel for model behavior
- Add your own observations or reference links

Think of it as a shared memory, not a source of truth.

## Contribution guidelines (high‑signal only)

If you add notes or references:
- Be specific about what you noticed
- Include context when possible (model name, date, use case)
- Prefer concrete observations over opinions
- Link to repos or posts if there’s supporting evidence

Short, honest notes are better than polished write‑ups.

## Design principles

- Human > automated
- Qualitative > quantitative
- Simple > impressive
- Notes > metrics

If a feature makes this feel like a benchmark, it probably doesn’t belong.

## Status

This is an intentionally small project.
If it helps even a few people remember what they tried and why, it’s doing its job.
